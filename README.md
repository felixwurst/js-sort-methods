# Sort Methods in JavaScript

### Exercise:

Find an alternative way to the method already implemented in javascript to sort an array.

I've found different sorting methods here:<br>

And two scripts for JavaScript here:<br>

One of them is a Selection Sort, the other a Insertion Sort method.
I took them as a starting point and tried to understand both of them with some comments and document.write lines. The insertion sort method is the more complicated because of the reversed loop within a loop. The Selection Sort is more easily constructed.

**Selection Sort:**<br>
Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.

**Insertion Sort:**<br>
An element has to find its appropriate place in a sorted sublist and has to be inserted there.
